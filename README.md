# OJO Hackathon 2021 - Customer Profile Shooter

[Demo Video](https://vimeo.com/637255705)

## How to play

Download [ojohackathon.gba](https://github.com/tmcleroy/ojohackation2021/blob/main/ojohackathon.gba) and play it in a [GBA emulator](https://mgba.io/) or flash cart on original hardware (tested working on an everdrive x5)

If you don't want to download an emulator you can try uploading `ojohackathon.gba` to this [browser based one](https://gba.ninja/), although it won't perform as well as a proper emulator or real hardware

## How to build (OSX)
`brew install lua@5.3`

follow brew printed instructions on how to add lua to your path

`lua build.lua`

`ojohackathon.gba` rom will be created
